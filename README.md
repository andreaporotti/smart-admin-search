# Smart Admin Search - WordPress Plugin

**NOTE:** this is a development repository. Please download latest stable release from the WordPress.org directory: https://wordpress.org/plugins/smart-admin-search/.

## Description

With Smart Admin Search you can quickly find contents in the WordPress dashboard without going up and down on the admin menu.

Just click on the top-right link or press a keyboard shortcut to open the search box, then type what you are looking for. Easy!

Currently Smart Admin Search can find:

- admin menu items: get a list of menu items matching your query, then press enter on the most relevant result to go to that page.
- (more contents coming soon...)

## Configuration

Settings for the plugin are available on the *Settings* -> *Smart Admin Search* page.

Some things you can do in the settings page:

- configure the keyboard shortcut to open the search box.
- disable any available search function.

## Permissions

The search box can be used by users of any role. Each user will get results available for the assigned role.
